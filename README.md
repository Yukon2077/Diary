# Notes

An Android application that can store what you write and save it in a SQLite Database and display it in the Home page in a particular order in which the latest entry would be at the top.

So a app like this could be used to **note** important things or used as a **Journal** or a **Diary**, but if you need it, use it for whatever purpose you want.

**Note:** This Android application is still in experimental stage. There aren't many important features implemented yet.
